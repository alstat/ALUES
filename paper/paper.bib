abstract = {Soil protection requires the improvement of agricultural land use, its planning and its management, in order to achieve a sustainable development. Land evaluation analysis is considered an interface between land resources survey and land use planning and management. The application of information and communication technology has exerted an impact on sustainable land use decision support. Since the early 1990s and following this trend, MicroLEIS (Mediterranean Land Evaluation Information System) has evolved towards an agro-ecological decision support system. The original project corresponds to a set of qualitative land evaluation methods converted to PC computer programs to automate their application. Today, MicroLEIS DSS is a set of useful tools for decision-making which in a wide range of agro-ecological schemes. The design philosophy follows a toolkit approach, integrating many software tools: databases, statistics, expert systems, neural networks, Web and GIS applications, and other information technologies. The MicroLEIS DSS system, in English and Spanish simultaneously, is available ready-for-use from the following website address: www.microleis.com. The new, re-designed MicroLEIS DSS will provide considerable opportunities for greater cooperation in interdisciplinary research and in the application of knowledge to solve problems of soil protection.}

abstract = {Agricultural land suitability evaluation for crop production is a process that requires specialized geo-environmental information and the expertise of a computer scientist to analyze and interpret the information. This paper presents ALSE, an intelligent system for assessing land suitability for different types of crops in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. mango, banana, papaya, citrus, and guava) based on geo-environmental factors that automates the process of evaluation and illustrates the results on an attribute table. Its main features include support of GIS capabilities on the digital map of an area with the FAO-SYS framework model with some necessary modifications to suit the local environmental conditions for land evaluation, and the support of expert knowledge through on spatial tools to derive criteria weights with their relative importance. A dynamic program for calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a weighting matrix is provided. Expertise and knowledge help ensure that ALSE databases represent realistic, practicable and functional systems. It is useful for decision makers to determine the quality of land for agricultural uses and is intended as a decision and planning support. Responsibility for any decisions based partly or wholly on the output of ALSE rests with the decision maker. ALSE ensures that the results are interpreted correctly within the relevant context, and contributes by maximizing land-use planning and decision support.}

abstract = {In this paper expert systems and geographical information systems technologies are combined to help with an implementation of a land suitability evaluation model. The result is the LEIGIS software, which allows empirical work within the framework of this paper. The model used is based on the FAO land classification for crops, and data which describe an agricultural area in terms of soil mechanics and environment. The land evaluation has two parts; the physical evaluation and the economic evaluation. For the physical evaluation of the land, data for 17 land characteristics have been used and a Boolean classification method has been applied. The implementation includes models for general cultivation and five (wheat, barley, maize, seed cotton, sugar beet) specific crops. A new interpolation function is introduced to map values to scores in terms of land characteristics. The economic evaluation includes income-maximization taking into account market restrictions. The expert system has been designed to help with the evaluation of land and to allow alteration in its rules based on different performance observed in local areas. The GIS functions help in managing the spatial data and visualizing the results. The software developed allows the evaluation and presentation of any equivalent spatial dataset and does not require special computer skills.}

Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.}

abstract = {Current methods of agricultural land evaluation in Queensland and other parts of Australia have been criticized for their inflexibility and lack of attention to costs (both private and social) associated with particular land uses. These deficiencies can limit the usefulness of land evaluation procedures in defining land capability and suitability for farm and regional land use planning. This paper outlines a new method based on soil potential ratings, that incorporates biophysical crop simulation modelling, expert systems and risk analysis. The technique is able to integrate biophysical and economic data in a measure which can be readily computed, updated and communicated to land managers.
