\title{Rainfed Upland Rice terrain requirement for land evaluation}
\format{
A data frame with 6 rows and 8 columns
}
\description{
A dataset containing the terrain characteristics of the crop requirements for farming Rainfed Upland Rice.
}
\details{
The following are the factors for evaluation: 

\itemize{
\item Slope1 - Slope (\%) (1. Irrigrated agriculture, basin furrow irrigation)
\item Slope2 - Slope (\%) (2. High level of managemnet with full mechanization. )
\item Flood - Flooding
\item Drainage4 - Drainage (Medium and fine textured soils)
\item Drainage5 - Drainage (Coarse textured soils - Sandy families)
\item SlopeD - Slope (degree, 6 classes)
