Contributing
============

Thank you for considering to contribute to ALUES, we appreciate the help :sparkling_heart:.
To make sure that we maintain the highest quality of code, we do have to adhere
to some strict guidelines though. Please read through this document to help you get up and running.

If you would like to report a bug, suggest enhancements, or request a new
feature, jump to the [Issues section](#issues).

Git + GitHub
------------

We use the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system to manage the
development with the repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).
If you are new to Git or GitHub, please read through the
[GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) to get up to
speed.

If you're already familiar with Git and GitHub, please read
[Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests).

Coding Style Guidelines
-----------------------

While we do have our own style in coding and haven't followed any standards available
in the web, we do maintain some uniformity. For contributors, we require the standards
defined in [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

If we missed to mention a particular case, you should always follow the below
procedure:

* See how it's done in the codebase.
* See what Advanced R convention says and choose something that's close to the codebase.
* If all else fails, ask :)

## Submitting Pull Requests

All changes to ALUES Tools must be in the form of pull requests.
If you are unfamiliar with pull requests, please read
[this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project>).

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you follow the guidelines
below while working on your changes:

* Each pull request should try to accomplish one general task.
* All work should be done on a branch with a descriptive name relating to the
  general task (eg. `fix_bug_x` or `add_feature_y`).
* Each individual commit should accomplish one small sub-task and should be
  explainable in a sentence or two.
* Each commit should have a descriptive commit message.
* You should make sure your code passes all tests before committing.

Issues
------

Not all contributions have to do with code.
If you would like to report a bug, suggest enhancements, or request a new
feature, please use the [issues page](https://github.com/CAMeL-Lab/CAMeL_Tools/issues) to do so.

Please adhere to the following rules when posting a new issue:

* Try not to post duplicate issues. Search through previous issues to see if
  your issue has been posted before.
* Create one issue per bug, enhancement suggestion, or feature request.
* Use appropriate labels to indicate the type of issue you are posting.
* Provide detailed information on the system you are running (operating system,
  R version, etc.), exact steps to reproduce the issue, sample input
  file(s), and the output produced when submitting bug reports.
