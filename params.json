{"name":"ALUES: Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System","tagline":"agriculture, package, r","body":"### Description\r\nAgricultural Land Use Evaluation System (ALUES) is an R package that evaluates land suitability for\r\ndifferent crop production. The package is based on the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the\r\nInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI) methodology for land evaluation. Development of ALUES is\r\ninspired by similar tool for land evaluation, Land Use Suitability Evaluation Tool (LUSET). The package\r\nuses fuzzy logic approach to evaluate land suitability of a particular area based on inputs such as rainfall, temperature, topography, and soil properties. The membership functions used for fuzzy modeling are the following: Triangular, Trapezoidal, Gaussian, Sigmoidal and custom models with functions that can be defined by the user. The package also aims on complicated methods like considering more than one fuzzy membership function on different suitability class. The methods for computing the overall suitability of a particular area are also included, and these are the Minimum, Maximum, Product, Sum, Average, Exponential and Gamma. Finally, ALUES utilizes the power of Rcpp library for efficient computation.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n```{coffee}\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(repo = 'ALUES', username = 'alstat')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nThe package contains several datasets, classified into two: i. Land Unit Attributes and ii. Crop Requirements.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
