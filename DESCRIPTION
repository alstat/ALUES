Description: Agricultural Land Use Evaluation System (ALUES) is an R package
    that evaluates land suitability for different crop production.
    The package is based on the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
    methodology for land evaluation. Development of ALUES is
    inspired by similar tool for land evaluation, Land Use
    Suitability Evaluation Tool (LUSET). The package uses fuzzy
    logic approach to evaluate land suitability of a particular
    area based on inputs such as rainfall, temperature, topography,
    and soil properties. The membership functions used for fuzzy
    modeling are the following: Triangular, Trapezoidal and Gaussian.
    The methods for computing the overall suitability of a particular
    area are also included, and these are the Minimum, Maximum, Product,
    Sum, Average, Exponential and Gamma. Finally, ALUES utilizes the
    power of Rcpp library for efficient computation.
