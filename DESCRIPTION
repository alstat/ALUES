Description: an R package that evaluates land suitability
    for different crop production. The package is based on
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the
    International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) methodology
    for land evaluation. Development of ALUES is inspired by
    similar tool for land evaluation, Land Use Suitability
    Evaluation Tool (LUSET). The package uses fuzzy logic
    approach to evaluate land suitability of a particular
    area based on inputs such as rainfall, temperature,
    topography, and soil properties. The membership functions
    used for fuzzy modeling are the following: Triangular,
    Trapezoidal, Gaussian, Sigmoidal and custom models with
    functions that can be defined by the user. The package also
    aims on complicated methods like considering more than one
    fuzzy membership function on different suitability class.
    The methods for computing the overall suitability of a
    particular area are also included, and these are the Minimum,
    Maximum, Product, Sum, Average, Exponential and Gamma.
    Finally, ALUES utilizes the power of Rcpp library for efficient
    computation.
